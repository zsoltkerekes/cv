  "<span>What you can expect from me:</span> Website development based on client's custom design, with the requested client-side functions, considering the current UI and UX expectations. If needed, I also write scripts on server side (to a low complexity level). After completing the tasks, I manage the entire life cycle of the website from deploying to maintenance, through further improvements, finally to the later exchange of the website.",
  "<span>Unfortunately, you can not count on me with:</span> Server side MVC systems, and JAVA language. If that you need, unfortunately I cannot help you - at least yet. I am open to new technologies, I would like to learn how to use MVC systems, or JAVA language."
